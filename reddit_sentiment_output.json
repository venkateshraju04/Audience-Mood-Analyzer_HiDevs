So me personally, if the one plus is cheaper than the s25 (including any Samsung trade in deals I can get of course) I'll be trying one plus for the first time. It's also going to have a bigger battery, brighter screen, and faster charging than the s25 and I like most of the pictures it takes better than the s24 so far from seeing the Chinese version. Now that said, if it's the same price as the s25 (or anywhere near it) hell no lol. The big selling point of one plus is you can get (most) of what high end Samsung and apple offer for 899 usually. I really don't want to give up good lock and secure folder, but if the s25 is still $400 more than the one plus 13 I'm going one plus if my trade in doesn't eat that up.",

My OP12 does much better with those shots but I still get a lot of very poor photos.  Trade offs I suppose.  \n\nGiven the Samsung ecosystem and availability of aftermarket accessories or replacement parts, I'm really inclined to go with Samsung anyway.  Someone was complaining about getting nibs for the OnePlus Stylo 2 and OnePlus didn't even sell them.  I looked myself, checked Amazon, looked on AliExpress, and concluded that it was way too much work for a consumable part.  Samsung?  Took me 30 seconds to find a bunch of replacements that could be delivered within 2 days.  OnePlus has to step up with after sale support if they want to remain competitive.",

Added a magsafe case and have no complaints.\n\n10pro still needs to be replaced (I need 2 phones) do I get another 12 as it is everything I want or upgrade. Price is $500 vs $800. I don't need the extra power, larger battery, ip69, or upgraded find my phone. BUT 13 is such a better price than competition I pulled the trigger.\nMy only issue is all the reviewers claiming 4 years of updates vs 7 is a deal breaker.\nAnyone buying 13 right now when just released is not going to not replace it within 4 years imo. My wife had iphone 13 she won't part with. Her battery life is half what a new phone would be and she is not a use phone all day like most of us.\n\nIf you wait a year the 13 & 13r will cost almost 1/2 as the 12 & 12r does now. If $ is a concern those are still flagship phones imo. Nothing on the market today except 13 holds a candle to my 12(unless best camera is your thing) \n\nI'm very excited for 13, wasn't planning on getting it but for the price why wait a year for a significant price drop?\n\nAs I always carry 2 phones I tried 1 apple and a galaxy and always a OnePlus, I've always thought OP was better options at less $. Now I just carry OnePlus and am much happier for it. Except for the 11 that was a disappointment.",

I would actually buy the 12 instead. And it's 13 is priced good I'd buy it too. I like to keep my phones for a number of years so that's the only reason why I won't upgrade. Plus there's absolutely nothing wrong with my 12R\n\nThat being said, I looked at phones for like 2 years plus trying to upgrade my old one. And the price always got me. And then I found one plus and it looked too good to be true for the price to performance ratio... Turns out it wasn't too good to be true it was a great deal in my opinion and I would pay it every single day of the week. \n\nHowever, like you said, if the price of these OnePlus phones as the years go on end up being what another flagship such as Samsung or Apple is, I just wouldn't buy the one plus anymore. If they start pricing OnePlus in the same atmosphere as the other flagship phones as much as I love my OnePlus phone I don't think it's worth it to buy it at that point. In my opinion it just doesn't offer anything outstanding compared to the rest at that price point. And I say this hoping they never do this because I would be extremely sad. As of right now they have a one plus customer for the rest of time in me unless they started doing this.\n\nEdit: reading your comment closer you're just asking if the reason I would buy a OnePlus is because of the price. The answer is no, I like a lot about this phone, but the price is certainly a massive massive reason why. If these phones become much more expensive like I said I just don't think they're worth it to buy when compared to these other devices.",

OxygenOS or even just stock is so much easier to use. The worst part is how Samsung pushes their own half-baked features that duplicate stock features while not properly replacing them. It's as if you've got two software suites trying to live together on the same phone.\n\nOfcourse this is personal preference and probably just what you're used to but I for one can't stand it. \n\nOn the other side the Samsung ecosystem is better. The watches mainly are better, and not as influenced by OneUI. Still the Samsung Health app is questionable to say the least. Syncing between OnePlus and Samsung phones is hilariously flaky, and some mysterious bugs appear on OnePlus and not on Samsung phones. \n\nFor me it'd be easy. Unless Samsung fires all of their OneUI team there will not be another Samsung device.",

The only negative I can say about the 12R right this second is if I had to replace the screen protector on the curved screen it would be such a hassle! And I LOVE the curved screen on this device. \n\nBut other than that, I've no issues with software or anything. But again, I'm a guy who doesn't care much about taking the best photos, or being able to do 15 things at once on my phone, etc. I'm definitely what you would call \"someone who is on his phone all day, but who just used it for general stuff\". I'll game, read Reddit, do some research for school, take the odd pic, snapchat, text, listen to music. But my productivity isn't insane.  \n\nI'm using it as we speak and nothing bad to report at all!\n\nI do have some experience with other brands, but I had my old Samsung phone for...geez, 7 years? And I currently own my 12R phone and a Samsung Galaxy tab 7+ haha, and that's a few generations old now! I mean, I just bought a laptop ~5months ago and that's an Asus. So, I'm kind of all over the place. \n\nIf I'm being completely honest, like I said, would I prefer this phone over say an iPhone or Samsung S23/24? Absolutely not. If the prices were similar I'd 100% have a Samsung right now because I like them, like the software, enjoy the experience I've had, etc. but I just can't justify dropping $1300 or whatever it is Canadian for a cell phone. I got this one after savings/deals for I think just under $600? Don't quote me on that. I personally feel that $400-800, in that range, is more than enough for a quality phone. Especially when most of the world replaces them so often. I don't know if I'm considered your average phone user, cheap, or \"special\" (lol) as I like to keep my devices for easily 4-5 years OR MORE if I can get away with it. And unless something magically is to change with my 12R or they make say the 13, 14, etc. At a super good deal, I don't plan on upgrading for years!",

As you said, if OnePlus starts pricing these phones much more as time goes by, I agree about not worth buying anymore.\n\nAnother reason to note about not buying is the accessories. My biggest complaint with OnePlus devices in general is the lack of accessories. If I buy a phone, I want to be able to have all the companies that Samsung always has making cases and what not available to OnePlus as well as I always have to dig deep to find something I'd like on Amazon or somewhere else and I rarely find anything good.\n\nThat's partially why I always end up going back to Samsung as I have been doing for years now ever since I first got the OnePlus 6. I ended up buying the Note 8/9 during that time, then my next OnePlus was the 8T after that, only to switch back to Samsung and got a Note 20 Ultra.
